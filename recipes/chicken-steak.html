    <h1>Homemade Lasagna</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> The aptly named chicken-fried steak is a dish that consists of steak fried in the same manner as fried chicken.
        The meat is coated with a seasoned flour mixture, then deep-fried to crispy perfection.
        A Southern favorite, chicken-fried steak is actually very similar to Wiener schnitzel (an iconic Austrian dish
        of breaded and fried veal).

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <div>Step</div>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and
            crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>

        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar.
            Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>

        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in
            the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set
            aside.</li>

        <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

        <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large
            bowl until combined.</li>

        <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat
            it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the
            remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles,
            cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to
            10 more minutes.</li>

        <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>
